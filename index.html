        <h3>Why do Astronmers Need to Use Many Types of Telescopes?</h3>
        <h4>Author: Nicholas Felarca <br> Published: 6:07 PM Sunday October 13, 2024  </h4>

            Astronomers make use of many telescopes for a variety of reasons. The most
            important reason for this is that telescopes can only see 1 or 2 parts of
            the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum at most. From highest energy to lowest
            energy rays it goes gamma, X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), visible infrared (IR), 
            microwave, and radio.

            For example, James Webb Space Telescope records in the visible and infrared spectrum. 
            Being able to see in the infrared spectrum is very useful as it helps observe very
            distant galaxies, which give us more information into the formation of the universe.
            We see farther back in time the farther we look away because it takes light time to
            get to us from that point so viewing something 10 billion light years away means that
            we are seeing something that happened 10 billion years ago.

            Chandara is an X-Ray telescope, which is better for recording higher energy
            events as they are at a higher frequency than all other bands besides gamma. This is extremely
            useful for observing high-mass end of life stars, black holes, and galaxy clusters.
