        <h3>Why do Astronomers Need to Use Many Types of Telescopes?</h3>

                <p>
                &emsp; Astronomers make use of many telescopes for a variety of reasons. The most
                important reason for this is that telescopes can only see 1 or 2 parts of
                the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum at most. From highest energy to lowest
                energy rays it goes gamma, X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), visible infrared (IR), 
                microwave, and radio. </p>
               
                <p>&emsp; For example, James Webb Space Telescope records in the visible and infrared spectrum. 
                Being able to see in the infrared spectrum is very useful as it helps observe very
                distant galaxies, which give us more information into the formation of the universe.
                We see farther back in time the farther we look away because it takes light time to
                get to us from that point so viewing something 10 billion light years away means that
                we are seeing something that happened 10 billion years ago. </p>
            
                <p>&emsp; Chandara is an X-Ray telescope, which is better for recording higher energy
                events as they are at a higher frequency than all other bands besides gamma. This is extremely
                useful for observing high-mass end of life stars, black holes, and galaxy clusters. There are a
                a variety of other telescopes used by NASA and other associations that collect other parts of
                the EM specturm to give astronomers as much information as possible about the universe.</p>

        <h3>Future NASA Missions to the Moon</h3>
        <h4>Author: Nicholas Felarca &emsp;  Published: 6:48 PM Sunday October 13, 2024  </h4>
        <div  class="row-styling">
            <div class="column">        
                <p>&emsp; The NASA Artemis program was created in 2017 and it was intended to establish the
                first human presence on the moon since the Apollo missions to the moon ended in 1972. Besides
                getting a person on the moon the program plans to create a perminent human presence around the moon
                and create a support space station above the moon.</p>
                
                <p>&emsp; The main components supporting the program are the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft. The
                Orion spacecraft will be used as the capsule that carries up to 6 astronauts between the Earth, Moon and possibly Mars.
                The Space Launch System (SLS) is the actual rocket that propels the Orion spacecraft into space and is designed to
                bring payloads into space. The SLS will also help get components for the Gateway, which will be the first space station 
                that orbits the moon for science and to help other critical missions.</p>
                
                <p>&emsp; Artemis I was completed in 2022 as a test of the Orion Capsule without any people in it. It flew beyond the moon in
                2022 and was completed successfully. Artemis II is a planned for September of 2025 and will be a flyby of the moon with 4 North
                American astronauts. Artemis III would see astronauts land on the moon and would happen at earliest on September 2026. The mission
                would have two astronauts land on the south pole of the Moon and spend a week on the Moon before returning to Earth. The last planned
                missions are supposed to put together the Gateway space station above the Moon and make it habitable.</p>
